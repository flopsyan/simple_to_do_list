# Installation Instructions
1. **Download the script**  
   Download the file `to_do_script.sh` and move it to a location of your choice.

2. **Make it executable**

3. **Run the script**
   Run the script and add as many arguments as you like (e.g., `./to_do_script.sh A new to do item`).

A file named `todolist.md` will be created automatically - this is where all of your to-dos are stored. You can edit this file however you like - new notes will be appended to the end of the file. You can also move it to another location, just make sure to update the file path inside the script accordingly.
